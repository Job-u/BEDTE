# BEDTE: AI and Speech Recognition for Preserving the Endangered Casiguran Agta Language

## Capstone Project Overview:

BEDTE (Bridging Endangered Dialects with Tagalog and English) is a capstone project that aims to preserve the **Casiguran Agta**, an endangered language spoken by the Agta community in the Philippines. This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **speech recognition**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to bridge the language gap and provide tools for speakers of Casiguran Agta, Tagalog, and English.

The goal of the project is to help preserve the Casiguran Agta language by enabling communication through an interactive web-based platform. It allows users to choose between using a microphone or typing text in **Casiguran Agta**, **Tagalog**, or **English**, with real-time translation and pronunciation guides. This platform is designed to aid in the documentation and teaching of the Casiguran Agta language, which is at risk of extinction.

## Key Features

- **Speech Recognition**: The application utilizes speech recognition technology to transcribe spoken language (Casiguran Agta, Tagalog, or English) into text, providing real-time translation and feedback.
- **AI-Powered Translation**: The platform uses AI and NLP algorithms to provide accurate translations and contextual understanding between Casiguran Agta, Tagalog, and English.
- **Pronunciation Guides**: The application generates pronunciation guides to help users correctly pronounce Casiguran Agta words.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The platform supports three languages — Casiguran Agta, Tagalog, and English — with easy language selection options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive user interface designed to be accessible for users of all ages, promoting language learning and cultural preservation.
- **Voice and Text Inputs**: Users can interact with the application via voice commands or typed input, making it versatile for various use cases.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end development of the web interface.
- **PHP**: For back-end server-side logic and database interaction.
- **MySQL**: For managing user profiles and storing language data.
- **Speech Recognition APIs**: Used for real-time voice-to-text transcription.
- **AI and NLP**: For language translation and contextual understanding.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the BEDTE project are:

- **Language Preservation**: To create an accessible tool for the Agta community and language learners to preserve and promote the use of the Casiguran Agta language.
- **Interactive Learning**: To provide an engaging and practical way for people to learn Casiguran Agta by combining technology with language education.
- **Data-Driven Translation**: To improve translation accuracy by using AI and machine learning techniques to handle variations in language structure and context.
- **Community Empowerment**: To provide tools for language speakers and learners to share their knowledge and collaborate in preserving the language.
